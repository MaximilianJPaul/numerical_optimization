To run the project, type 'python3 main.py' in the command line.

Caution: The active set method may sometimes throw 'numpy.linalg.LinAlgError: Singular matrix' due to random nature of selection of starting points.
In this case, just try to rerun the program.


Part 1: Simplex Method

The implementation of the simplex method for feasible starting points can be found in: src/simplex_method_feasible.py
The implementation of the simplex method for infeasible starting points can be found in: src/simplex_method_infeasible.py

The results can be found in: ./report-simplex.txt
Problems: ./problems-simplex.txt


Part 2: Active Set Method

The implementation of the active set method can be found in: src/active_set_method.py

The results can be found in: ./report-active-set-method.txt
